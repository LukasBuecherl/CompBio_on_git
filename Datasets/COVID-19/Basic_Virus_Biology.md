# Basic Biology of Viruses 
A brief introduction compiled by Sam Flaxman, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.  

Though many guides exist on the web, a non-biologist friend asked me to put this together, so I thought I would share.  Comments and suggestions are welcome (email to samuel.flaxman@colorado.edu).

## 1.  Why do biologists say that viruses technically are NOT "alive"?

Viruses!  Yes, neither living nor dead.  The definition of "life" in biology includes that a living organism is made of one or more cells.  Viruses do NOT have cells, and thus don't meet this criterion.  However, they do replicate, which means that they can mutate and evolve.  Because they have no cells, in order to replicate themselves, they must get INSIDE the cells of a host organism.  Since different organisms have different chemical signatures on their cell surfaces, a virus is usually only able to infect a small number of species.  In short: Viruses are "obligate intracellular parasites."  This means that they can not do their business of replication without getting inside the cells of a host.  In order to replicate, a virus uses the host cell's molecules.  This is one reason that we can't treat viruses with antibiotics: they are using OUR OWN biochemical processes to replicate themselves.  We usually can't disrupt these processes without disrupting our own.  Instead, in order to treat or "kill" a virus, a drug has to be found that interferes uniquely with something about the virus, such as some unique enzyme it may have, or its method of attachment to our cells.  (For "killing" viruses with with soap or disinfectant, see below ...)

Since a virus doesn't have cells of its own, a single virus is often referred to as a "particle" (rather than a cell).  You can think of the particle like a cardboard box.  The structure of the box is made of proteins.  The contents of the box are the genome. The box has "keys" on its surface that enable entry to a cell.  When the particle contacts the right kind of host cell, the key opens a path into the cell, and the genome is then "unboxed", i.e., released into the cell so that it can start directing the synthesis of new viruses.  A virus is just a self replication machine; a parasite that does one thing really well: get its host to make more copies of the virus.

Many viruses that infect animals additionally have a membrane surrounding the particle.  Viruses with such a membrane are called "enveloped".  This membrane is derived from the host cell when the viral particle exits the cell.  (Going back to the box analogy in the previous paragraph, you can think of the membrane like wrapping paper around the box.)  In chemical terms, these membranes are made of fats.  Influenza and COVID-19 are examples of "enveloped" viruses.

## 2. What does "replication" mean for a virus?  
We humans replicate ourselves, sort of, by having babies.  A virus makes copies of itself by harnessing the powers of its host cell to assemble new viral particles.  Those particles eventually break out of the cell, and can then go on to infect new cells, thus repeating the process.  Here's an illustration I found online:

Notes about the image: (1) That image is for a kind of virus that infects bacteria, called a "phage", but the principles of replication are the same for many viruses.  (2) The orange oblong shape is the host cell, the blue lines are the virus genome, and the purple shapes make up the protein coat that goes around the virus's genome.

##  3. DNA, RNA, Genomes, and Replication
I said viruses replicate themselves using our own cells' machinery.  But what exactly is being replicated?  
A virus has a genome.  Of course, living organisms also have genomes.  In each of our human cells, we have a copy of our genome.  A human genome is the complete set of genes possessed in one human body cell.  Each gene is a unit of "instructions" for how to make a cell and an organism run.  The human genome contains roughly 20,000 genes.  Viral genomes are much, much smaller.  Many viruses may only have around 10-20 genes or so.  [One article on coronaviruses that I found from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369385/) had identified around 20 genes.  You might have learned that genes and genomes are constructed of repetitive building blocks, frequently represented by the letters A, T, G, and C.  You can think of one letter in the genome as being like a single lego brick; one gene might be hundreds or thousands of letters long (like several hundred lego bricks stuck together).  The entire human genome is 3 billion letters long.  Coronavirus genomes are around 30,000 letters long.

The genomes of living organisms are written with those four letters mentioned above, A, T, G, and C, which are the building blocks of DNA.  The genes of different viruses are sometimes constructed with DNA, sometimes with RNA.  RNA is also built with four basic "letters":  A, U, G, and C.  Influenza and SARS (including COVID-19) are RNA viruses.  DNA and RNA are very similar in many ways; in chemical terms, they are both "nucleic acids".    All genomes -- viruses, human, or otherwise -- are made of nucleic acids.  All genes are sequences letters in nucleic acids.    In other words, nucleic acids are the language in which the "recipes" for life's biochemical processses are written.  Why are so many viruses of public health concern RNA viruses (rather than DNA)?   A rough answer is that RNA viruses tend to evolve faster and thus are hard to keep up with.

### The genes in the virus genome: what do they do?  
Several of the genes encode structural proteins; these are proteins that are used to package the virus, i.e., to make a new particle. Some genes may encode the "keys" that enable a viral particle to enter a new host cell.  Some genes may encode enzymes that are unique to the virus's operations.  Some genes may have no function we have been able to identify.  

The key is that, when a virus replicates, you get lots of new particles.  Each particle is a complete viral genome packaged in protein coat (and a membrane, if applicable).  When new particles break out of a cell, they can go on to infect new host cells and repeat the process.

##  4. "Killing" a virus with time, soap, sanitizer, chemicals, etc...
Since viruses aren't alive, they can't be killed per se, but people say "kill" a lot.  We might more accurately think of that as "deactivation."  Here's an analogy.  Suppose you have a functional bicycle. If you leave it outside exposed to the elements, it may eventually get so rusty and corroded that it can't be pedaled anymore.  Likewise, a viral particle exposed to the elements degrades over time (much faster than a bicycle rusts, thankfully!).  Eventually, a viral particle might become so degraded that, even if it were placed onto a host cell, it wouldn't be able to infect it.  The same forces that break down a neglected bicycle -- water, heat, UV radiation, etc. -- can break down viral particles.  This degradation can include breakdown of the membrane, the protein coat, and/or the genome.  Chemicals that "kill" viruses -- such as hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes -- make this breakdown happen fast.  

Returning to the bicycle analogy: suppose you smash a bicycle into a bunch of pieces.  You can still tell it was a bicycle, but it can't be ridden at all.  Thus, when investigators find COVID-19 RNA bits on some surface of a cruise ship, it can be like finding a broken bit of a smashed bicycle. If you find a bicycle cog, you know for sure that there was a bicycle there, but there's absolutely no way that having only one cog can create a functional bicycle.  

The extent of the breakdown process is what determines whether the viral particle sitting on a surface can still be infectious or not (just like the extent of damage to a bicycle determines whether it can still be pedaled or not).

New information on how long COVID-19 can remain infectious on various surfaces is being published every day.  Keep an eye on unbiased news sources for reliable reports.  With this and everything else: Please don't automatically trust what you "hear" on social media.  Find the original sources.

## 5. Replication and Spread
The rush for N95 (and other) masks following the advent of COVID-19 was driven by people's knowledge that it, like many respiratory viruses, can be spread through airborne droplets.  How many viral particles are likely to be in a cough, sneeze, or droplet?  That is still under study.  [Here is a link to a study on influenza from 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4676262/).  In that study, the investigators found that the average cough of someone sick with influenza contained around 75,400 influenza viral particles.  However, keep in mind that COVID-19 is a different virus, everyone coughs slightly differently, and even within one person, there is huge variance from one cough to the next.
