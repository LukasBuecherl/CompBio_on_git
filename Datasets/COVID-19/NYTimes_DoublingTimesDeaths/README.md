# Deaths and Death Rates from COVID-19 

This directory has two example plots from the New York Times.  These images were taken as screeshots on March 24, 2020, around 11:55 a.m. from  [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html)
